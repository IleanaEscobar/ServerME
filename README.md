# Server ME

Server ME is an open-source JavaScript library that works with Express.js, Mongoose.js, and Node.js. Targeted towards beginners, Server ME helps people unfamiliar with back-end coding quickly set up a web server and API with a database connection.

# Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

# Features

- Creates an Express server that connects to MongoDB.
- Creates common routes
- Creates routes for Get/Post requests

# Usage

At the current moment, Server ME can create an Express server that connects to MongoDB. To use this library with MongoDB, create an account[here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). After creating your account, create a project and a cluster. Connect your database by allowlisting your IP address and connecting your Atlas Cloud Uniform Resource Indentifier (URI).

Alternatively, use the test URI to connect to Server ME's demo server:

```
mongodb+srv://guest:AndoverCSC630@testcluster.z1itv.mongodb.net/TestDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
